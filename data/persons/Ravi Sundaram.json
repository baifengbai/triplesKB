He is interested in network performance and approximation algorithms for the design and efficient utilization of networks. He enjoys devising efficient schemes for improving the performance of network based applications and validating their use through innovative systems implementations. He is also interested in network security and game theoretic aspects of network usage. In the past he has worked in complexity theory and combinatorics.\n\nProfessor Sundaram joined Northeastern in the fall of 2003. Prior to that he was Director of Engineering at Akamai Technologies, where he played a critical role in the buildout of the world\u2019s leading content delivery network; he established the mapping group which is responsible for directing browser requests (over 10 billion a day) to the optimal Akamai server.\n\nEDUCATION\n \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology                                                                     Cambridge, MA\nPh.D., Electrical Engineering and Computer Science                                                     August 1996\nThesis: Interactive proof systems and approximation algorithms for optical networks\nAdvisor: Professor Michael Sipser, Department of Mathematics, MIT\n \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology                                                                     Cambridge, MA\nM.S., Electrical Engineering and Computer Science                                           August 1993\nThesis: Spanning trees short or small\nAdvisor: Professor Michael Sipser, Department of Mathematics, MIT\n \nIndian Institute of Technology                                                                         Madras, India\nB.Tech., Computer Science and Engineering                                                          July 1991\nPresident\u2019s Gold Medallist \u2013 top-graduating student across all majors at IIT Madras\n \n \n \n \nEXPERIENCE\n \nNortheastern University, College of Computer and Information Science              Boston, MA\nProfessor                                                                                                        May 2014 - current\n\u00b7         Networking algorithms\n\u00b7         Algorithmic game theory\n\u00b7         Network science\n \nAssociate Professor                                                                         September 2003 \u2013 April 2014\n \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology          & Akamai Technologies, Inc             Cambridge, MA\nResearch Scientist                                                                 October 2002 \u2013 September 2003\n\u00b7         Working on research problems in performance (measurement and improvement), algorithms for (ad-hoc and other communication) networks, and mobile and distributed systems.\n \nAkamai Technologies                                                                                    Cambridge, MA\nProduct Manager                                                                       July 2001 \u2013 September 2002\n\u00b7         Managed three product lines that collectively generated over $20 million annual revenue \u2013 Akamai Infrastructure Management and Analysis (user interface), Edgescape (IP intelligence) and Akamai Secure Content Delivery (SSL)\n\u00b7         Created multi-quarter roadmap for Engineering based on customer requirements and competitive demands and generated technical white papers and service descriptions for Sales\n\u00b7         Wrote grant proposals to defense agencies in the areas of security and cyber-surveillance\n \nDirector of Engineering                                                                       July 1999 \u2013 June 2001\n\u00b7         Managed a group that grew from 5 to 35 \u2013 23 developers and 12 scientists(PhD) over 2 years\n\u00b7         Led teams to deliver four new products from concept and design through to launch.
