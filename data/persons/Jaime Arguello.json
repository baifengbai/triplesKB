Within IR, my main focus is on aggregated search, where the goal is to provide search across many different systems, or verticals, from a single search box. From the system side, I develop methods for predicting which verticals to present and where to present them in response to a query. From the human side, I run user studies to better understand search and preference behavior under different situations and with different aggregated search interfaces. In addition to IR, I am also interested in machine learning, text data-mining, and human-computer interaction.\n\nCourses\n\nINLS 509 - Information Retrieval\n\nINLS 609 - Experimental Information Retrieval\n\nINLS 613 - Text Data Mining\n\nFunded Projects\n\nNSF Career: Making Aggregated Search Results More Effective and Useful\n\nNSF-Sponsored Workshop on Task-based Information Search Systems\n\nPublications\n\nDissertation\n\nJaime Arguello.
